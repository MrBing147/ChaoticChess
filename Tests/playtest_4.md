## Playtest 4 – Capturing and HP Reduction

1. Move pieces until an attacking move is possible (for instance move
   a pawn forward two squares so that an opposing pawn can be captured).
2. Select a piece and target an opposing piece that is highlighted for capture.
3. Upon moving, the captured piece’s HP should decrement by one. Pawns
   have 1 HP while major pieces have 2–3 HP.
4. If the target’s HP drops to zero it is removed from the board. If
   there is remaining HP the piece stays and displays fewer heart icons.
5. End of test.
