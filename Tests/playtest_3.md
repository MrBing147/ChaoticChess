## Playtest 3 – Knight Movement

1. With the board in its initial state, select a Knight. For example, click
   on the White knight at column 1, row 7.
2. Observe that the knight’s legal moves are highlighted. Knights move
   in an L‑shape (two squares in one axis and one in the orthogonal axis).
3. Verify that there are two to three valid moves depending on whether
   pawns obstruct some squares.
4. Click a highlighted square to move the knight. The knight should jump
   over any intervening pieces and land on the chosen square.
5. End of test.
