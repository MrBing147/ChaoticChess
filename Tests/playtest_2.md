## Playtest 2 – Basic Pawn Movement

1. From the `DemoMatch` scene ensure it is White’s turn (indicated by the
   absence of any selection). White pieces start at the bottom of the board.
2. Click on a White pawn located at column 0, row 6 (the leftmost pawn on
   the second rank). The pawn should become selected and legal moves are
   highlighted in green.
3. The pawn should have up to two possible moves: one step forward (to
   column 0, row 5) and two steps forward (to column 0, row 4) because
   it is on its starting square.
4. Click the square one step forward. The pawn moves to that square,
   the highlight disappears, and the turn switches to Black.
5. End of test.
